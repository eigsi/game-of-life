# Game Of Life - Shool Project
This java game is inspired by the [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). 
## :scroll:Description
This game is a school project from the **Coding Week** at [EIGSI La Rochelle](https://www.eigsi.fr). During this project we had 4 days, in group of 2, to build a game based on the **Game of Life** with different objectives to complete.  
We successfully completed all of them, so this is the final version of the game as intended.

## :wrench: Installation
### 1 Launch the game (Java 22 needed)
If you already have Java 22, you can launch the game directly :
- MacOS
```html
java -cp bin:src/eigsi.jar Main 
```
- Windows
```html
java -cp "bin;src/eigsi.jar" Main
```
### 2 Compilate and Launch
If you have a different version of Java, you need to compile the project first : 
```html
javac -cp src/eigsi.jar -d bin src/Main.java
```
Then launch the game with the same command as before.

## :octocat: Technologies
- **Java 22** or a compatible version
- **eigsi library** provided by our school
- **JDK** (Java Development Kit) required for compilation
